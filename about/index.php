	<p class="lowercase"><strong>DDUGOFF</strong>, designed by Daniel DuGoff, is a New York-based menswear label. Launching for Fall/Winter 2014, <strong>DDUGOFF</strong> fills a void in the modern man’s wardrobe - unbasic basics. Taking the essentials and making them special - clean shapes such as t-shirts, sweatpants, sweatshirts in fine yet easy to wear fabrics - <strong>DDUGOFF</strong> lies halfway between going to work and staying at home, because realistically that’s how we live and dress.</p>
